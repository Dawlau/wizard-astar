At the entrance of the cave an old wizard gives the young wizard a pair of boots that is the same color as the parcel at the entrance and the old wizard says that the young wizard will die if he walks over a parcel of color x if he has a pair of boots with color different from x. The young wizard also has a bag where he can keep an additional pair of boots of any color. Some parcel may contain a pair of boots. The young wizard may take the pair of boots from the parcel and change it with the equipped boots or the boots that he has in the bag. The wizard has to find a way to get the stone and get back to the entrance of the cave
